## Overview

This project provides an interactive web application to demonstrate and compare different numerical integration techniques, including:

- Midpoint Rule
- Simpson's 1/3 Rule
- Simpson's 3/8 Rule
- Trapezoidal Rule

The application allows users to input custom functions or discrete data points and visualizes the integration process.

## Features

- Interactive user interface built with Streamlit
- Support for both continuous functions and discrete data points
- Real-time calculation and visualization of integration results
- Comparison of estimated values with actual integrals (for continuous functions)
- Error calculation and display
